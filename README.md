| **Predicting** | The Goal is to detect if someone is wearing a mask or not willing to wearing mask
| **Data**       | cocodataset -  https://cocodataset.org/#download Created my own dataset from download images from google extension
| **Features**   | Images shape(416x416x3)
| **Models**     | Yolo V3 (Darknet 53) https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet
| **Results**    | Having train enough images yet to see how accurate the model is. 
| **Discussion** | Well I got the model to work but it wasn't as fast as i wanted the image to run. The Fps was very low. How every went i use someone else weight and classes the accuracy was 95% of predicting object classes that it pretrain.  
| **Future**     | In the future, i would want to try a faster model like YoloV5 and input more images for my model to start training more accuracy. I would also want to add a feature where it would predict a person body temperature. To see if someone walking in to a public area is sick or not.
